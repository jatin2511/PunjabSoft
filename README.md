# About project
 This project is a React-based application designed for efficient and scalable student data searching. Key features include:

-------Lazy Loading: The app loads data only when necessary, improving performance.

-------Debouncing with Lodash: The search input uses lodash debounce to prevent unnecessary API calls.

-------Search Criteria: By default, the autosearch feature works with a minimum of 3 characters. However, if a user wants to fetch data with just 2 characters,   they can click the "Search" button.
```
